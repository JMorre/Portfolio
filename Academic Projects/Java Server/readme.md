This project is a Java implemented web server, designed to handle user accounts, uploads and access to a variety of information pertaining to a "family map" program assigned as a CS lab.  
I also created an android app for interfacing with this server, not included here.
Has some external jar dependencies. 
Data in the json folder is sample data only.
