This no longer works, since youtube has since changed their url scheme, and it never implemented a decryption scheme for youtube's video security anyway.  But it used to be an all in one program for taking a url, detecting its playlist, downloading all videos, and using ffmpeg to convert them to mp3 files.  
I've always meant to come back to this one and find out how to decrypt these video urls, but that's a difficult project that would take a very long time.  VLC media player can do it... but not sure I can.
