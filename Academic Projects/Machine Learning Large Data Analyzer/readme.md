A python project created for Procter & Gamble, my code contribution is included here, with some data ommitted.  
This is designed to read a large .csv based dataset of timestamped factory information, with the goal of analyzing it and predicting when a factory error is imminent.  
The code reads data and constructs a machine learning model that should hopefully be useful in the above goal.
